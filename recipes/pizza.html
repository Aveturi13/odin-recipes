    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Forget the old Chicago vs. NY debate! America's best pizza could very well be Detroit-style pizza. Even though it's often referred to as a 'deep dish,' I don't think that accurately captures the essence of this crispy, crusty, crazy-good slice. It has flavor elements of a slightly charred thin-crust pizza, with the texture of light, airy focaccia. Plus, if you use the properly shaped pan, the edges of your crust get wonderfully crunchy, making for a truly unique experience.</p>
    <p>While this recipe is awesome, I don't think its vegeterian friendly as it contains pepperoni! So I've made some slight modifications.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 cup of warm water</li>
        <li>1 package of active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 tsp white sugar</li>
        <li>3 tsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>2.5 cups bread flour</li>
        <li>1 jar of marinara sauce</li>
        <li>1 tsp of red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>Mozzarella cheese (shredded)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Extra Toppings (to make it vegeterian-friendly!)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Jalapenos</li>
        <li>sundried tomatos</li>
        <li>Onions (red and white)</li>
        <li>Bell Peppers - can use red, yellow and green peppers to make it more colorful!</li>
        <li>Zucchini</li>
        <li>and if you're courageous, try pineapple!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Pour warm water into the bowl of stand mixer; mix in yeast and sugar and let dissolve. Add 2 teaspoons olive oil, salt, and bread flour. Knead mixture together with a dough hook attachment until dough is very smooth, soft, and elastic.</li>
        <li>Drizzle remaining olive oil over the bottom of a 10x14-inch Detroit-style pizza pan and spread around with your fingers. Place dough in the center; pull and stretch into a roughly rectangular shape with oiled fingers. Cover and let rise until doubled in volume, about 1 hour. Prepare sauce and cheese in the meantime.</li>
        <li>Combine marinara sauce, oregano, red pepper flakes, and garlic powder in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Simmer to fully hydrate the oregano and garlic, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 500 to 550 degrees F (260 to 288 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Rub fingertips with some olive oil from the pan. Press out air from the dough while stretching and pushing into a rectangle that goes all the way to the edges of the pan. Stretch up the sides about 1/2 inch or so.</li>
        <li>Add the vegetable toppings generously on the dough and then cover with the mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until pizza is somewhere between golden brown and golden black, about 15 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Very carefully slide pizza onto a cutting board using a spatula. Cut into individual pieces using the lines of sauce as a guide.</li>
    </ol>
